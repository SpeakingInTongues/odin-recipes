        <h4>The cloudier the more particular. The more particular the less common. Hypebeast.</h4>
        <p>Imagine, if you would, a pair of dentures. Sitting there, in a glass, on some ancient bedside table.</p>
        <p>Maybe you are imagining the dentures from Red Dragon. Those biters. Those bite marks. Criminal Evidence.</p>
        <p>Aren't you forgetting something though? Don't they...float?</p>
        <p>What sort of beverage is so tasty that someone would want to perpetually submerge their dentures in it?</p>
        <p>Let's quench that posthumous thirst.</p>
