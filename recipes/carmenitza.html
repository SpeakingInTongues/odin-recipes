        <h4>Double Chocolate Cookie Topped With Pizza</h4>
        <p>For this recipe we combine a quick mix double chocolate cookie dough baby
            with all of the toppings typically reserved for pizza dough. Pizza Sauce, Peppers, Salami, Mozzarella. 
            Whatever floats <em>your</em> chocolate-ee pizza-ee boat. We truly mean <em>whatever</em>.

         <h6>Ingredients</h6>
         <ul>
             <li>Quick Mix Double Chocolate Cookie Mix or Premade Cookies</li>
             <li>Pizza Sauce</li>
             <li>A Meat</li>
             <li>A Pepper</li>
             <li>Mozzarella</li>
        </ul>
        <h6>Steps</h6>
        <ol>
            <li>Follow the steps on the quick mix up to the point they are being baked. If you've selected
                premade cookies then you'll be getting down with that charcoal crunch. In the world of branding
                we call that charcoal flavour gothic. But remember, this isn't activated charcoal and so it
                is not going to detoxify your body.</li>
            <li>Then we smother the cookie(s) with the pizza sauce. Dab it. Apply a hair thin layer. Dip it. Whatever.</li>
            <li>Time for the toppings. Throw your meat on that cookie. Slice of salami. Full on pork chop. Whole pepper. Slice pepper. Whatever.</li>
            <li>Then blanket that topped up cookie in a slab of mozzarella. This'll trap in all those sweaty flavours.</li>
            <li>Follow the quick mix baking time, maybe go back in time and do steps 2 through four in the middle of the bake time, OR, IF YOU CHOSE A DRY COOKIE, bake for eight minutes to sog it up.</li>
            <li>Enjoy</li>
        </ol>
